Of course. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the third principle of prompt engineering, "Provide Examples," presented in the same detailed and structured style.

Objective
The primary goal of this lesson is to introduce the third principle of effective prompt engineering: Providing Examples. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to insert a diverse set of correct examples (a technique known as "few-shot" prompting) into your prompt to make the AI's output significantly more reliable and aligned with your specific needs, albeit with a trade-off in creative freedom.

üí° Key Points
Here are the most critical takeaways on providing examples:

‚ùó 

What is "Providing Examples"? It is the practice of inserting a set of test cases into your prompt that show the AI exactly how the task should be done correctly. This is also known in AI research as "few-shot" prompting, as opposed to "zero-shot" where no examples are given.


üéØ 

Reliability Over Creativity. Providing examples dramatically increases the reliability of the AI's output. However, it comes at the cost of creativity, as you are constraining the model to follow the specific patterns you've shown it.


üí∞ 

A More Costly Tactic. This method is considered more "costly" than giving direction or specifying format because it requires you to find, select, and insert good examples into your prompt.


üîÑ 

Diverse Examples = Diverse Responses. The diversity of your examples directly influences the diversity of the AI's output. If all your examples follow a strict pattern (e.g., all product names start with "i"), the responses will also follow that pattern.


üñºÔ∏è 

Image-to-Image Examples. In image models like Stable Diffusion, providing an example is called "image-to-image". You upload a source image and can set a "weight" (e.g., 35%) to control how strongly that example influences the final output.


üé® 

Image Examples Constrain Style. Just like with text, an example image can heavily constrain the output, influencing not just the shape and form but also the color palette and overall style. If you provide a black and white image, it can be difficult to get colorful results.



üìç 

Placement Matters. A good practice is to place your examples in the middle of the prompt: start with the main task, follow with style directions, then insert the examples.

Summary and Explanation for Naive Users
Imagine you're teaching a child to draw a star.

A prompt without examples is like saying, "Draw a star." You might get a five-pointed star, a six-pointed star, or just a bright yellow circle. The result is unpredictable.

A prompt with examples is like saying, "Draw a star. Here are some I drew earlier," and then showing them three perfect five-pointed stars. Now, the child knows exactly what you mean by "star." You have constrained their creativity (they probably won't draw a six-pointed star), but you've made their output incredibly reliable.

Providing examples to an AI is just like that. You are showing it, not just telling it, what you want. For text, if you give it three product names that all start with "Apple," it will generate more names that start with "Apple". For images, if you show it a picture of a sleek, black shoe, it will generate new shoes that are also sleek and black. You are giving the AI a blueprint to copy, which is the most powerful way to control the final result.


üé≠ Creative Activities for Memory Retention
The Poetic Mimic:

Activity: Find a short, four-line poem with a simple A-B-A-B rhyme scheme.

Task: Ask an AI to write a new poem about a completely different topic (e.g., "the future of space travel"). In the prompt, provide the poem you found as an example of the style and structure you want. For instance: "Write a four-line poem about space travel. Here is an example of the style I like: [insert your example poem here]."

Goal: Observe how the AI adopts the rhyme scheme, rhythm, and even tone of your example. Try it again with a different style of poem (like a haiku) to see how the output changes.

The Visual Blender:

Activity: Find two very different images online: for example, a picture of a modern sneaker and a picture of a classic, ornate teapot.

Task: Use an AI image generator that supports "image-to-image." First, generate an image with the prompt "a futuristic shoe" and upload the sneaker image as an example. Next, generate an image with the same prompt but upload the teapot image as the example.

Goal: This will dramatically illustrate how a single example image can completely hijack and redefine a prompt, forcing the AI to blend the prompt's idea ("futuristic shoe") with the example's style ("ornate teapot").

A.  True
B.  False 

In image generation, what is the term for using an uploaded image as an example?
A.  Image prompting
B.  Image-to-image 


C.  Style transfer
D.  Visual direction

If you provide an AI with three example product names‚ÄîiCar, iPhone, iPad‚Äîwhat is the most likely pattern the AI's suggestions will follow?
A.  The names will be random.
B.  The names will all be related to Apple products but without a specific prefix.
C.  The names will all start with the letter "i".


D.  The names will be about cars and phones.

‚ùì Question and Answer
Q1: How many examples are best? One? Ten? A hundred?


A: The video notes that researchers test models with varying numbers of examples, from one to a hundred. There's no single perfect number. Even one strong example (like in image-to-image) can have a huge impact. A few diverse examples (3-5) are often a good starting point for text. The key is quality and relevance, not just quantity.



Q2: What happens if I provide bad or conflicting examples?
A: Garbage in, garbage out. If you provide low-quality, confusing, or contradictory examples, the AI will likely produce a low-quality or confused response. It will try to find a pattern in your examples, and if the pattern is messy, the output will be too. It is crucial to "cherry-pick" good, clear examples.

Q3: Can I combine providing examples with the other principles, like giving direction and specifying format?
A: Absolutely. The video mentions that the most effective, "engineered" prompts use all five principles together. For instance, you could have a prompt that (1) gives direction by asking for a "Steve Jobs style," (2) provides examples of names starting with "i," and (3) specifies the format as a "comma-separated list." Combining principles gives you the most control.
